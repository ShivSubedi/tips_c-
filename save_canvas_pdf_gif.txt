//This snippet of code shows how to save a canvas as a gif, pdf


//Saving a canvas as gif for iterative runs in a loop
can->SaveAs("plot.gif+10");

//Saving canvas as pdf. When placed inside loop, gives the pdf of the total runs in loop
can->SaveAs("plot.pdf");


//Saving individual pdf's for each run in the loop
//saving the canvas as multiple pages in pdf
//If there are 10 graphs to save,

//1.  for first graphs do:
  if (cnt_MC == 0)
  {
    can_eff_plot->SaveAs("plot_first_graph.pdf[","pdf");
  }
//2.for the intermediate graphs do:
  can_eff_plot->SaveAs("plot_graph_2_9.pdf","pdf");
  }
//3. For the last graph do:
  if (cnt_MC == (tot_MC-1))
  {
   can_eff_plot->SaveAs("plot_tenth_graph.pdf]","pdf");
  }
