//This snippet of code is developed to define and draw a graph


//A. For TGraph

 //1. Read in the data values in two columns via "ifstream"
 ifstream datafile;
 datafile.open("xy.data");  //xyz.data is the name of datafile, contains two coloums let x and y


 //2. Read the variables in an array while going through the data loop.
 x[i]=
 y[i]=

 //3.Define a canvas to plot graph
 TCanvas *can=new TCanvas();

 //4. Draw the graph with no array in the variable.
 gr->Draw(n,x,y)


 //5. For multiple graphs in the same canvas, repeat steps 2 and below (except 3) and while drawing set Draw("PSame")

 //6. For plotting errors as well
  (a) Replace TGraph -> TGraphErrors
  (b) gr-Draw(n,x,y,ex,ey);



 //B. For TGraph2D
 //Follow either of the following two procedures


  Procedure 1: (Is applicable for TGraph as well)
    1.Define the graph before the data loop.
     //TGraph2D *gr = new TGraph2D();
    2. fill the data in the graph (similar to histogram) while in the data loop
     //gr->SetPoint(n,x,y,z); where n is the increment after each data variation
    3. Draw the graph outside the data loop
    //TCanvas *can2=new TCanvas();
    //gr->Draw("CONT4Z");  //For drawing the contour plot


  Procedure 2: (Is applicable for TGraph as well)
   1. fill the variables for which graph is to be drawn in an array inside the data loop
	  //x[n]= ..;  where n is the increment after each data variation
	  // y[n]= ..;
	  // z[n]= ..;
   2.Draw the TGraph2D outside the data loop after defining the canvas
    //TGraph2D *gr = new TGraph2D(n, x, y, z);
