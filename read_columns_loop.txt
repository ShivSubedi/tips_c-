//This snippet of code is written to read different columns of a data file and perform needed operations.
//This can be done via various loop statements,eg:
//For-loop -> use this loop if you know the number of rows
//while loop -> you can use this loop until end of data file without knowing the number of rows
//Below shows how to use above conditions:



A. While loop

ifstream datafile;
datafile.open ("xyz.data"); //xyz.data is the name of data file
count = 0;
while (!datafile.eof())        //goes until the end of datafile
{  //while loop begins
  datafile>>c1[count]>>c2[count]>>c3[count]>>c4[count]>>c5[count]>>c6[count];

  // operations on column files


  //BREAKING OUT OF A LOOP
  if (c1[count] < 0.000001) {break;}
  datafile.ignore();
  count=count+1;

  }   //while loop ends

datafile.close();
count=count-1;

//Above while loop gives one count more than the actual reading in the data at the end
//The last data file is a very very small number randomly assigned.
//To avoid the last data file, use the break statement as shown with a small value assigned.



B. For loop
ifstream datafile;
datafile.open ("xyz.data"); //xyz.data is the name of data file

for (int count = 1; count < n; count++ ) //n->number of rows
{  //For loop begins
  datafile>>c1[count]>>c2[count]>>c3[count];

 // operations on column files

 datafile.ignore();

}   //For loop ends

datafile.close();
