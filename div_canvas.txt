//This snippet of code shows how to divide a canvas into two for plotting two graphs on top of each other

TCanvas *can= new TCanvas();
can->Divide(1,2,0,0);        //Divides the canvas into one column and two rows

can->cd(1);                  //calls the first row
//Draw the first graph here ..

gPad->SetBottomMargin(0.0);    //Sets the bottom margin of first graph to be 0.0

can->cd(2);                  //calls the second row

//Draw the second graph here ..

gPad->SetTopMargin(0.0);     //Sets the top margin of plot of second graph to be zero.


//NB: SetLeftMargin(..), SetRightMargin(..) can also be used in similar fashion
