//This snippet of code shows how to avoid reading the strings present as heading in any data file


1.Open the datafile via 'ifstream'
 ifstream datafile;
 datafile.open ("xyz.data");
2. string first_string;    //assign a parameter in the string name, do it for as many rows of strings
3. std::getline(datafile, first_string);  //getline the srings name in the data file, do it for as many rows of strings
4. Read the datafile as normal now.
