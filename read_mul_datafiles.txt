//This snippet of code is written to demonstrate how to read multiple data files in a loop
//and also perform operatios in their respective data values


//Reading columnwise data values from multiple datafiles
for (int i =1; i<=n; i++) //n -> total number of data files
{                                                          //data loop begins
  ifstream datafile;
  datafile.open (Form("xyz%d.data",i));         //Data files are arranged as xyz1.data, xyz2.data, ....xyzn.data
  count = 0;
  while (!datafile.eof())                     //goes until the end of data values for each data file
  {  //while loop begins
   datafile>>c1[count]>>c2[count]>>c3[count]>>c4[count]>>c5[count]>>c6[count];  //do this for all the colums in the data file

   // operations on column files

   datafile.ignore();
   count=count+1;

  }   //while loop ends

 datafile.close();
 count=count-1;


} //data loop ends
