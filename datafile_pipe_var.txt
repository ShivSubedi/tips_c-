//This snippet of code shows how to read in a data file and pipe in the values of the datafile to a variable
//This variable can then later be called in a different loop and then plotted against another variable if desired.

//pipe in values from datafile to an array of next variable
ifstream datafile;
datafile.open("x.data");  //x.data is the name of datafile

for(i=1;i<=n;i++) //n->total number of values in the datafile
{
 datafile>> time[i];
}
