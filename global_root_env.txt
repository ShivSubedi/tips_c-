//You can use options like 'gStyle' to define common draw format in a macro
//However, instead of defining the format in each macro, you can also write a file
//to contain the format you want root to take for each compilation.
//For this, follow following steps.

//1. Define a file name (eg. 'root_global_env.C') and save it in the home directory
 //a. In the beginning of this file, define 'mystyle' as:
   TStyle *myStyle  = new TStyle("MyStyle","My Root Styles");
 //b. Now, define all the common environment codes using 'myStyle'
 //c. Apply the above defined new style
  gROOT->SetStyle("MyStyle");


//2. With your preferred text editor open file '~/.rootrc'

//3. Inside the 'rootrc' file, write and save:
Rint.Load:~/root_global_env.C

//4. Now, everytime you run root, the above global environment is implemented.
