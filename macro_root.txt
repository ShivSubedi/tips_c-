//This snippet of code shows the programming structure of a macro in C++ and executing it via root

//C++ code starts with following format i.e.
void filename1 ()
{
 <body of program>
}
and saved in .C format (say filename2.C)

(a) If the filename1 matches with name in which it is saved i.e. filename2 , we can execute the .C file directly as: root <filename2.C>
(b) else, we follow following steps
1. root -l <enter>              //initiates root
2. .L filename2.C <enter>       //loads the file
3. filename1() <enter>          //executes the macro
