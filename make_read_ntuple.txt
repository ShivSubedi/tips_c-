//This code shows how to create ntuples in a .root file and also how to read the .root file
//ntuple provides a way to save different set of information in a common file (eg. <filename>.root ) in different brances
//These branches can later be accessed and read to plot and compare the information saved in different branches


A. How to create .root file and ntuple

void <filename_macro> ()
{ //void loop begins
  TFile *file = new TFile("my_root_file.root", "RECREATE");
  TNtuple *ntuple = new TNtuple("ntuple","my file","temp:rho:j:time:mass");   //here temp, rho, j, time and mass are different branches

  //loop begin (finding the values of variables in the root file

  //for filling root file
  float ntuple_var[]=                //ntuple variables always need to be defined as float
 {
   temp,rho,j,time,mass
 };
 ntuple->Fill(ntuple_var); //filling entries in the root file

  //loop ends (for finding the values of variables in the root file


 file->Write(); //writing the root file
} //void loop ends

B. How to read the .root file and ntuple

TFile *plot1 = TFile::Open("path of root file.root");

Float_t temp, rho, max_mass, time, j;  //all variables in the root file assigned Float_t

TTree *ntuple = (TTree *) plot1->Get("ntuple");
ntuple->SetBranchAddress("temp",&temp); //first one is from the root file, second one is what variable first pair is assigned in following codes
ntuple->SetBranchAddress("rho",&rho);
ntuple->SetBranchAddress("max_mass",&max_mass);
ntuple->SetBranchAddress("time",&time);
ntuple->SetBranchAddress("j",&j);

Int_t nentr = (Int_t)ntuple->GetEntries();      //Gets the total entries in the ntuple file

ntuple->GetEntry(nn); //nn goes through each entry
