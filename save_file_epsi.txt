//This snippet of code shows how to save a file in .epsi format
//The highlight of this format is it cuts unncessary empty edges around a plot
//and also saves a plot in high definition

1. Savefile in ps format
2. ps2epsi filename.ps  //saves file in epsi format
3. ps2pdf -dEPSCrop filename.epsi  //saves file in epsi.pdf format
4. Open filename.epsi.pdf
