//This snippet of code shows the labels that can be defined with gStyle
//When gStyle defined with these labels in the beginning of macro, this will be effective for all the plots drawn by the macro

gStyle->SetTextFont(72);  //sets the font of all the text except axis labels
gStyle->SetTitleFont(62,"xy"); //applies the font style in xy axis, can be applyed for z axis as well 'xyz'
gStyle->SetTitleSize(0.05,"xy"); //applies the font size in xy axis
gStyle->SetPadTickX(1); //sets the tick mark on both side of the X-axis
gStyle->SetPadTickY(1);//sets the tick mark on both side of the Y-axis
gStyle->SetTitleOffset(0.7, "xy"); //sets the offset of title from the axis
gStyle->SetLineWidth(4);  ////sets the X-axis, Y-axis and graph line size
