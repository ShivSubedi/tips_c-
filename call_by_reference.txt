//This snippet of code shows how to call by reference a. single value b. array of values from one file to another



//*********************************************************************
    //CALL BY REFERENCE 'single value' IN C++
//**********************************************************************
     #include "xyz.C"
    void abc()  //saved in a file abc.C
    {
      Double_t out1;
      xyz(&out1);  //here &passes the address and * receives it in another program
      cout<<out1<<endl;
    }


    void xyz(Double_t *out)  //saved in a file xyz.C
    {
      //let's say has an output i.e. 'out' that needs to be passed in the void 'abc' program
       *out = .....
    }


 //*********************************************************************
    //CALL BY REFERENCE 'array' IN C++
  //**********************************************************************
    #include "xyz.C"
 void abc()  //saved in a file abc.C
    {
      Double_t out1[max];
      Double_t my_res[max];
      xyz(out1);  //here &passes the address and * receives it in another program

      for (Int_t run1 =1; run1<=max; run1++)
	{
          my_res[run1] = out1[run1];
        }

      cout<<out1<<endl;
    }


    void xyz(Double_t out[])  //saved in a file xyz.C
    {
      //let's say has an array of output i.e. 'out[]' that needs to be passed in the void 'abc' program
      for (Int_t run =1; run<=max; run++)
	{
          out[run] = .....
        }
    }
