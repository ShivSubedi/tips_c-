//This snippet of code shows how to define a cut window on top of TGraph


//1. Mark the window by two vertical lines along the y-axis
TLine *t1=new TLine(x1,y1, x1,y2); //draws a line at a particular point (x1) in X-axis in a window along Y-axis
t1->Draw();

TLine *t2=new TLine(x2,y1, x2,y2); //draws a line at a particular point (x2) in X-axis in a window along Y-axis
t2->Draw();


//2. Define a cut window based on above lines and shade it
TGraph *cutg= new TGraph(4);
cutg->SetPoint(0,x1, y1);
cutg->SetPoint(1,x2,y1);
cutg->SetPoint(2,x2,y2);
cutg->SetPoint(3,x1,y2);
cutg->SetFillStyle(3002);
cutg->SetFillColor(15);
cutg->Draw("fsame");


//3. Label the cut window
TLatex *l=new TLatex(10,1e3,"Gamow window"); //writing in the window
l->Draw();
